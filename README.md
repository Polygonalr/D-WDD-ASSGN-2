# DIPLOMA PLUS IN WEB DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT - ASSIGNMENT 2
This is the second project which I had done for the Diploma Plus program.

This is a basic online music store with a web music player for sampling purposes. PHP is used to load the data of the store from a SQL database.

All music and album artworks are obtained from Jamendo for non-commercial purposes.
